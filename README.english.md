This project was completed by Almudena Ocaña, José Martín, Mario Jiménez, and Rafael Gamero. The focus of this project is the collection, cleaning, and analysis of global shark attack data, with the goal of identifying trends and patterns in these incidents. Python, along with several popular libraries, was used for data manipulation and visualization.

Here is the link to the presentation we created for this project: [Project Presentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGP5pNSUQA/3x50Dx_h9nqfgPP_SlYHxg/edit).

Libraries Used:
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib: For creating visual charts.
seaborn: For advanced data visualizations.
cleaning: A custom module for data cleaning and filtering

Dataset Description:
The dataset was downloaded from the URL: 'https://www.sharkattackfile.net/spreadsheets/GSAF5.xls'. It contains information about shark attacks, including country, state, the activity the victim was engaged in, and the date of the attack.

Analysis Steps:
Load Data: Data was downloaded and read directly from an Excel file.

Data Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned by removing irrelevant columns and correcting date formats.

Statistical Analysis:
Top 10 Countries with Most Attacks: A graph was created showing the number of attacks by country since the year 2000.
Top 5 Most Dangerous Activities: Activities with the highest number of attacks were identified.
Monthly Attacks: Attacks were grouped by month to observe temporal patterns.
States with Most Attacks: A graph was created for the top 5 states/provinces with the highest number of attacks.
Attack Frequency by State and Activity: A stacked bar chart was created to show the distribution of attacks in key states and the activities the victims were involved in.
Visualizations:
Key visualizations generated throughout the analysis include:

Bar Chart: Top 10 countries with the most attacks since 2000.

Bar Chart: Top 5 activities with the highest number of attacks.

Bar Chart: Monthly distribution of attacks.

Stacked Bar Chart: Distribution of attacks by state and activity.

Conclusion:
This project helps to visualize and better understand the patterns of shark attacks worldwide. Through data analysis and visualizations, we can identify the activities and regions with the highest risk.
