Shark Attacks Data Analysis
Overview
This project aims to analyze shark attack data from 2000 to 2024 to identify patterns and assess risk factors for maritime tourism. By understanding these trends, we aim to provide insights into optimizing coastal excursions and activities, while reinforcing the companyâ€™s focus on safety as a key differentiator.

Business Case
A maritime tourism company plans to organize coastal excursions and water activities. While shark attacks are extremely rare, they cause significant fear among tourists. The company sees an opportunity to optimize its programs and routes while highlighting safety as a competitive advantage.

Problem
Although shark attacks are uncommon, they create significant concerns for tourists engaging in water activities.

Opportunity
Optimize excursion routes based on risk patterns.
Reinforce brand image by emphasizing safety in marketing campaigns.
Objectives
Identify patterns and risk factors associated with shark attacks.
Determine the safest water activities for tourists.
Analyze geographical differences in shark attack distribution.
Hypotheses
"Snorkeling is safer than surfing."
"Shark attacks are more frequent in certain regions and times of the year."
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is based on recorded shark attacks from various sources. The initial dataset was messy, containing inconsistent column names and irrelevant data.

Dataset Cleaning Process:
Columns selected for analysis: Date, Country, State, Activity.
Applied data cleaning functions to standardize column names, remove duplicates, fix date formats, and categorize activities.
Filtered the dataset to include attacks from 2000 to 2024.
Methodology
Step 1: Data Cleaning
Standardized column names and removed unnecessary columns.
Cleaned the date and activity columns using custom functions.
Filtered the dataset to the relevant time range (2000-2024).
Step 2: Basic Statistics
We calculated basic statistics to identify the most common shark attack scenarios:

Most attacked country: USA
Most attacked state: Florida
Most common activity: Surfing
Step 3: Combining Data
We combined variables such as country, state, and activity to extract patterns:

USA, Florida, Surfing: 89 attacks
Australia, New South Wales, Surfing: 49 attacks
Step 4: Data Visualization
Using visualizations to explore the data:

Top 10 countries with the highest number of shark attacks.
Most common activities during shark attacks.
Monthly distribution of shark attacks.
Top 5 states with the most shark attacks.
Key Insights and Conclusions
Surfing is the most dangerous activity, with the highest number of shark attacks globally (31.5%).
Geographical concentration: The USA, Australia, and South Africa account for two-thirds of all recorded attacks.
Regional hotspots: Florida (USA) alone accounts for 41.6% of shark attacks, especially during surfing.
Temporal distribution: Attacks are relatively evenly distributed throughout the year, with no significant concentration in any particular month.
Low-risk activities: Activities like snorkeling have a significantly lower risk of shark attacks.
Business Impact
We can confidently design safe maritime excursions by focusing on low-risk activities and avoiding high-risk areas like Florida during surfing.
Marketing campaigns can highlight safety and risk mitigation, reinforcing the brand's image as a safe choice for water-based activities.
